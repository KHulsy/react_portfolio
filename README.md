## Welcome to My Read-Me 

# Abstract(Grader:Please Read to the End)
During the second week of the program, after stores temporarily opened after Covid, I booked my wedding dress appointment in downtown Los Angeles. It was a Saturday. I was an hour late to the appointment. I wanted to code more than I wanted to find my wedding dress. I wanted to read more about this thing that I had never known about(or aboot, depending on who you're talking to). The only thing I knew about coding before was that Anonymous was cool and Bitcoin made about as much sense as The Illuminati. Anyway, as my Sikh mommy bartered with the owner for a Covid-19 discount, I had found my dress in one try. George Floyd had been murdered mere weeks before. Los Angeles was angry. I was, too. As I got in the car, I thanked God that "she's from Bakersfield" put me in some weird category like I was homeschooled or terminally ill. I drove home, and proceeded to read more about coding. I believe I was still beckoning Siri to open VS Code for me. I'd had a functioning laptop with RAM for about a week(thank you, Dan). In the words of Britney Spears, "coding is hard, y'all". Bart had not yet sent me step-by-step instructions to do a Git pull origin master. Jerome had not murdered me(it would have been justifiable). Manuel was still patiently showing me how to do MKDIR(which btdubs does not mean market directory). There is no market directory in Fight Club. I give the reader these ridiculous anecdotes because tonight I talked with local host. Local host talked back. I never thought I was going to do that. I read every single requirement, and then researched my tiny black heart out. I have snowflakes that swim backwards. I have links that work(still working on Github). I have a future, and Jerome in his freakish ability to push Irish girls, has prevented me from becoming stagnant at thirty-four.I've been an adjunct for almost ten years, and were it not for the kindness of previous strangers, I would be an adjunct with no other prospects for another ten.This is the hardest and most wonderful thing I have fought to achieve in my lifetime. Thank you. Every one of you. Thank you for all that you do. They're playing the music...
